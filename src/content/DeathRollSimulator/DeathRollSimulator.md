The WoW Death Roll Simulator lets you experience the thrill of playing 'Death Roll'
without risking your in-game gold. It's a simple game where two players roll the dice
alternately. The dice size always changes to the last value rolled by the opponent.
The first player to roll a 1 has lost the round.
